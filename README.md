Fine-tuning the LHDN E-Invoice information by gpt-4o-mini

This repository focuses on fine-tuning the LHDN E-Invoice information base for deployment, enabling people to easily access answers via a chat app. Although E-Invoice has been implemented, many users still have questions. Our goal is to use the fine-tuned model to assist people effectively.
